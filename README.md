Building a C# Sudoku Solver to practice my C# and design skills

## Inspiration

Numb3rs is one of my favorite Tv shows. Drama, Comedy, and Mathematics ... What more could you ask for? The following fake text message is a partial script from All's Fair (Season 2, Episode 18) that has always made me laugh and is my motivation for this coding exercise.
